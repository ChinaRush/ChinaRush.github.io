# 前言
Leslie Lamport，著名的Paxos算法和LaTeX的创建者，在他的论文中谈到程序员做错了什么?
答案：Not thinking enough

'''
For quite a while, I’ve been disturbed by the emphasis on language in computer science.
One result of that emphasis is programmers who are C++ experts but can’t write programs that do what they’re supposed to.
The typical computer science response is that programmers need to use the right programming/specification/developmentlanguage
instead of/in addition to C++. The typical industrial response is to provide the programmer with better debugging tools,
on the theory that we can obtain good programs by putting a monkey at a keyboard and automatically finding the errors in its code.
